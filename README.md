## Disclaimer

WARNING: Use this tool at your own risk. I take no responsibility for lost save files, corrupted saves, bricked consoles, etc.

The methods used here are very inexact and are based around random forums posts online. For many consoles, custom firmware (CFW) may be required. That is outside the scope of this project, but links to more resources will be provided.

The tool itself modifies arbitrary bytes of the save files, so there is a possibility that things go wrong. Always make backups of your saves.

## Scope

The scope of this project is just to help automate save file conversions between platforms.

To actually modify attributes of the save to manipulate the data, see existing tools such as [FFXED](https://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-FFXED-Final-Fantasy-X-Save-Editor?pid=66458), [Final Fantasy X Editor](https://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-Final-Fantasy-X-Editor-v2-0-3), or [Celsius](https://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-Celsius-FFX-2-Save-game-editor).

## Compatibility

Below is the compatibility chart going to/from the Nintendo Switch.

### FFX

#### Supported 

Aside from Xbox, I believe all of the others should be doable just based on my research. I could not find anyone attempting this with Xbox.

This is the list of implemented save conversions, so far.


| Supported | Nintendo Switch | Steam | PS2 | PS3 | PS4 |  PS Vita | Xbox One |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|-----|-----|-----|----------|----------|
| Nintendo Switch | - | YES | YES | YES | NO | YES | NO |
| Steam | YES | - | YES | YES | NO | YES | NO |
| PS3 | YES | YES | YES | - | NO | YES | NO |
| PS4 | NO | NO | NO | NO | - | NO | NO |
| PS Vita | Yes | YES | YES | YES | NO | - | NO |
| Xbox One | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO | - |

#### Verified

'Verified' means that I tried going to/from the console to confirm it worked.

| Supported | Nintendo Switch | Steam | PS2 | PS3 | PS4 |  PS Vita | Xbox One |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|-----|-----|-----|----------|----------|
| Nintendo Switch | - | NO |NO | NO | NO | NO | NO |
| Steam | NO | - | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO |
| PS3 | NO | NO | NO | - | NO | NO | NO |
| PS4 | NO | NO | NO | NO | - | NO | NO |
| PS Vita | NO | NO | YES | NO | NO | - | NO |
| Xbox One | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO | - |

### FFX-2

This 'should' be implementable. But I don't have saves to test it. This is a stretch goal for me.
